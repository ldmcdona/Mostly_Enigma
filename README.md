# Mostly_Enigma
An enigma machine program I built in the summer of 2019.

I've come back to this project in 2020 to properly comment everything so that I can rebuild it in C++.
Have done some minor fixes and will probably redo comments a few times.

EDIT: I can only conclude that I was an idiot while making this. My apologies. 

C++ version will be here: https://github.com/ldmcdona/Mostly_Enigma_Cplusplus
